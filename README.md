# MDST Autograder

## TODO

Backend:

-   Result comparison for cp 0
-   Result comparison for deterministic cp1
-   Code check for non-deterministic cp1
-   Tests are ran immediately when user submits.

Need:

-   Set up CICD pipline
-   Set up pytest for unit and integration testings. Test all routes, clear DB
