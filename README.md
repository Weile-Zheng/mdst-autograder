# MDST Autograder

## TODO

Fronend:

-   Downloadable link for users

    Backend:

-   Result comparison for cp 0
-   Result comparison for deterministic cp1
-   Code check for non-deterministic cp1
-   Tests are ran immediately when user submits.

Need:

-   Set up CICD pipline
-   Set up pytest for unit and integration testings. Test all routes, clear DB

    -   Test individual routes
    -   Test edge cases
    -   Full end to end testing
    -   Real user testing and feedback
